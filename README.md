### Introduction
---
This paper aims to bridge the gap between efficiency and accuracy in time series forecasting, particularly in scenarios involving exogenous inputs. A feature-filtering gating module composed of MLP and sigmoid is constructed for this purpose. Furthermore, we leverage global tokens extracted from endogenous sequences to filter valid information from exogenous input sequences. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on 7 benchmark datasets and 5 real-world datasets with external inputs; meanwhile, compared with mainstream Transformer-based models, it exhibits a 30% improvement in running speed.
